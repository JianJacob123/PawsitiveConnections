*Challenges and Solution*:
One of the significant challenges we faced during the development of this system was choosing the right framework that would best support its features and functionality. Initially, we struggled with compatibility issues and limitations within certain frameworks. To overcome this, we extensively researched alternative options and utilized online resources, such as tutorials, forums, and technical documentation. This approach not only helped us find a more suitable framework but also deepened our understanding of the tools, ultimately allowing us to build a more efficient and scalable system.

*Next Steps*:
The next steps for this system involve developing and integrating key elements such as messaging, user feedback mechanisms, blog posts and documentation. This process will entail clear and engaging communication that resonates with the target audience, ensuring the messaging is consistent across all platforms. Additionally, gathering and analyzing user feedback will be crucial in refining the system’s functionality and content, enabling continuous improvement and a more tailored user experience. The blog content, in particular, will need to be both informative and engaging, offering valuable insights to users while aligning with the system's broader goals of knowledge about pets, community building, and user engagement. Lastly is the documentation, which will serve as a resource for users and developers alike, providing clear instructions, and detailed explanations of the system’s features and functions. As also the part of the Academic requirement.
